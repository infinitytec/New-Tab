# New Tab
A modern, functional, customizable New Tab page.
# Goals
The purpose in creating this porject was to make a new tab page that offers the links I most want with a modern UI.
# General Configuration
Download the code to your computer. This is so the site is locally hosted and loads faster.

For making a link, simply follow this template and place the completed template(s) in the indicated area in the index.html file:
<a href="https://(YOUR URL)"><img src="resources/(YOUR LOGO).png" alt="icon">(LINK NAME)</a>
      (JUST REPLACE THE AREAS LIKE THIS WITH THE REQUIRED INFORMATION)

The links render from left top to right bottom. The higher the link is makes the icon appear higher.

For link images, use your favorite image editor. They go in the resources folder. The links are 125 by 125 pixels. By default, these are PNG.

For the background image, replace the resources/background.jpg image with any other image named background.jpg.

# Setup
For Firefox:

Get the New Tab Override extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)

Set the Option to "custom URL."

Enter the location you saved the code to in the URL box. There are other options you may want to explore, such as clearing the location bar, but thattends to clear it every time you open something in a new tab.

That's it! You have a brand-new new tab page! 

For Chrome:

Chrome is not yet supported by this New Tab project. Support will come soon.
